# Source Control Management & Software

> Source control management (SCM) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. SCM systems provide a running history of code development and help to resolve conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources. SCM is also synonymous with version control.
>
>Source code management systems are software tools that coordinate a software development team's coding work. Examples of source code management systems include Bitbucket, IBM Rational Clearcase, Github, and Apache Subversion.
>
>SCM allows teams to collaborate on the same application at the same time. It also allows project managers, developers, and testers to keep track of source code while it is in development, while it is in testing, and once it is deployed. SCM forces users to access the code in a controlled manner and prevents developers from writing over each other.

>If something goes wrong, you can make comparisons in different code versions and revert to any previous version that you want.

Below are some of the differnt flavors of SCM software and services.

## [Git](Git/Git.md)

>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### Services Powered by Git
- ### [GitHub](Git/GitHub.md)
    - >GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
    - >GitHub is an online software development platform for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It's a web-based interface that uses Git, an open source version control software that allows multiple people to make changes to web pages at the same time. GitHub makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with other developers on open-source projects. It also allows for real-time collaboration, encouraging teams to work together to build and edit their site content.

- ### [GitLab](Git/GitLab.md)
    - >GitLab is an open source code repository and collaborative software development platform for large DevOps and DevSecOps projects.
    - >GitLab is a web-based Git repository and DevOps platform that allows software development teams to plan, code, test, deploy, and monitor product changes in one place.


- ### [BitBucket](Git/BitBucket.md)
    - >BitBucket is a cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, track and control changes to their code, and collaborate on their source code. It provides a central place to manage Git repositories, and offers features such as access control to restrict access to source code, continuous delivery lines, pull services for comments and code review, and integration with Jira and Trello. BitBucket is built on Git, which is a distributed version control system.


- ### [AWSCodeCommit](Git/AWSCodeCommit.md)
    - >AWS CodeCommit is a version control service hosted by Amazon Web Services that you can use to privately store and manage assets (such as documents, source code, and binary files) in the cloud.
