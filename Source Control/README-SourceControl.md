# Source Control Management & Software

> Source control management (SCM) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. SCM systems provide a running history of code development and help to resolve conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources. SCM is also synonymous with version control.
>
>Source code management systems are software tools that coordinate a software development team's coding work. Examples of source code management systems include Bitbucket, IBM Rational Clearcase, Github, and Apache Subversion.
>
>SCM allows teams to collaborate on the same application at the same time. It also allows project managers, developers, and testers to keep track of source code while it is in development, while it is in testing, and once it is deployed. SCM forces users to access the code in a controlled manner and prevents developers from writing over each other.

>If something goes wrong, you can make comparisons in different code versions and revert to any previous version that you want.
